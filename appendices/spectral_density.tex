\section{Spectral density \label{appendix:spectral_density}}

\subsection{Cross power spectral density and power spectral density}
The cross power spectral density (CPSD) between a signal $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
	P_{xy}(f) \equiv \int_{-\infty}^\infty\ R_{xy}(\tau) e^{-i2\pi f \tau}\ d\tau\,,
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the frequency, $i$ is the imaginary number, and
\begin{equation}
	R_{xy}(\tau) \equiv \lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T\ x(t)y(t-\tau)\ dt
\end{equation}
is the correlation function between $x(t)$ and $y(t)$.
The power spectral density (PSD) of a single signal $x(t)$ is then defined as the cross power spectral density between the signal $x(t)$ and itself, i.e. $P_{xx}(f)$.

\subsection{Amplitude spectral density}
The amplitude spectral density of a signal x(t) is simply defined as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{x}(f) \equiv \left[P_{xx}(f)\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Coherence}
The coherence between two signals $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ is then defined as
\begin{equation}
	C_{xy}(f) \equiv \frac{\left\lvert P_{xy}(f)\right\rvert^2}{P_{xx}(f)P_{yy}(f)}\,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Sum of signals}
If we have two signals that can be expressed by superposition of other signals, i.e. $x(t)=x_1(t)+x_2(t)$ and $y(t)=y_1(t)+y_2(t)$, then the cross spectral density between $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ is
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		P_{xy}(f) &= \lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T\ \int_{-\infty}^\infty\  \left[x_1(t)+x_2(t)\right][y_1(t-\tau)+y_2(t-\tau)]\,e^{-i2\pi f\tau}\ dt \\
		&= P_{x_1y_1}(f) + P_{x_1y_2}(f) + P_{x_2y_1}(f) + P_{x_2y_2}(f)\,.
	\end{split} 
\end{equation}
\subsection{Uncorrelated signals}
If $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are uncorrelated signals, then their correlation function $R_{xy}(\tau)$ and $R_{yx}(\tau)$ is 0, and so is their cross power spectral density.
For a signal that can be expressed a sum of two uncorrelation signals, $z(t)=x(t)+y(t)$, then its PSD is
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		P_{zz}(f) &= P_{xx}(f) + P_{xy}(f) + P_{yx}(f) + P_{yy}(f)\\
		&= P_{xx}(f) + P_{yy}(f)\,.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Transfer function}
The transfer function with input $x(t)$ and output $y(t)$ is can be estimated by
\begin{equation}
	P_{X\to Y} = \frac{P_{yx}(f)}{P_{xx}(f)}\,.
\end{equation}
