	abstract = {Fluctuations in the position or propagation direction of the laser beam (beam jitter) is one of the most critical technical noise sources in an interferometric gravitational wave detector. These fluctuations couple to spurious misalignments of the mirrors forming the interferometer and potentially decrease the sensitivity. In this paper we calculate the transfer function of beam jitter into the gravitational wave channel for the Advanced LIGO detector and derive a first expression for the requirements on beam jitter for Advanced LIGO.},
