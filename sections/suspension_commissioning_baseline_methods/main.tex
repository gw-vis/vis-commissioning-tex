\section{Suspension Commissioning Baseline Methods \label{sec:suspension_commissioning_baseline_methods}}
In this section, we will discuss some methods that can be used to tackle tasks as listed in Sec.~\ref{sec:list_of_tasks}.
This section will include ``baseline'' methods, which are some techniques that we considered to be the standard, or the fallback, methods that must work.
They are sufficiently decent methods that should theoretically get the suspensions to satisfies the requirements.
These are also methods that has been used previously by various expert at KAGRA, so these shouldn't new to many of us.
However, these methods can be suboptimal.
For advanced methods, please refer to the next section, Sec.~\ref{sec:suspension_commissioning_advanced_methods}.
